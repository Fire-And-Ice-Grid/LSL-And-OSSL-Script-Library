When a user clicks the prim they will get a menu offering to tp them or give information about the place. The information option will deliver all prim contents other than the script and the location note card. It will work inside the same sim, going to another sim or even another hypergrid destination

This script is written in OLSL and will not compile in second life but works in Opensim under both the X and Y Engine.

Add a new script to the prim
